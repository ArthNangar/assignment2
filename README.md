# Python Calculator with Tests

## Overview
This project is a **basic Python calculator** that can perform the four main arithmetic operations:  

- Addition  
- Subtraction  
- Multiplication  
- Division  

It includes **automated testing with `pytest`** and a **continuous integration workflow via GitHub Actions** to check that all calculator operations work properly.

## Features
- Command-line interface for entering calculations  
- Supports negative numbers and decimals  
- Automated tests with `pytest`  
- Continuous Integration (CI) using GitHub Actions

## How to Use
1. Activate your Python environment:  
   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
2. Enter calculations in the format:
   ```bash
   number operator number
   8 + 12
   -7 * 4
   15 / 3

   -8*-6   Invalid format
    7+-14  Invalid format



## Learning Outcomes
- This project helps you practice:
- Writing Python programs with automated tests
- Setting up GitHub Actions for continuous integration
- Building a simple command-line calculator application
